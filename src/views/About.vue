          We here at The Quiz Zoneâ„¢ believe in asking questions, that's why we're here to bring you many quality quizzes peer reviewed by credible scientists, authors and historians. We believe in a future where everyone can ask questions and be asked.
          Questions are what make us human, without questions we could not understand one another. That is why the quiz zone believes in open source and free platforms to make the world a better place for inquisitive minds 
          place. I don't know why I made this page it probably will not get me any extra points but I hope you at least found this somewhat humorable. Perhaps I should have gone into marketing rather than coding.
